# Identification Mapping to DwC-DP

We will assume that the identification is based on the material entity in the case of DiSSCo.
This might change but for now there is no way of knowing how the identification has come to be.
Otherwise most fields align there are a couple of new fields that are not present in openDS.
We might need to add these to openDS in the future.

The identification taxon has a completly different structure than the taxonIdentification in openDS.
This might not necessarily be a problem as we can map the fields one to one.
However, in the future we need to consider changing the structure of the taxonIdentification in openDS.
