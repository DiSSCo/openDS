# Agent Mapping to DwC-DP

The structure for agents is a bit different in openDS and DwC-DP.
Where DwC-DP uses the agent role as a coupling between the subject and the agent, openDS sees the role as part of the agent.
The difference are bridgable but might result in some issue at a later stage.

Agents got relatively few fields and mapping is possible for most of them.
