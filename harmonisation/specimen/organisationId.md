# OrganisationId

## openDS
Will be harmonised to `ods:organizationId`
This is a new term that we will register in the openDS ontology.
We will use ROR identifiers as globally unique identifier for the organisation.

## Mapping
The organizationId needs to be set in the default mapping.
It is often part of the data, however often the ROR is not included.
The fields contain a widely heterogenous set of names/identifiers.
As we want a stable organisationId based on the ROR this information needs to be provided.
This also makes the assumption that all specimen in the dataset belong to the same organisation.
