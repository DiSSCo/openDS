# SourceSystemId on Specimen level

## openDS
Will be harmonised to `ods:sourceSystemId`
This is a new term that we will register in the openDS ontology.
It is the source system which provided DiSSCo with the data (often the CMS).
It has a one-to-one mapping to the endpoint from which we have pulled the data
The sourceSystemId is a PID.

## Mapping
The source system identifier has been generated by the DiSSCO infrastructure.
A translator is always coupled to the sourcesystem, so this field is provided by DiSSCo.
