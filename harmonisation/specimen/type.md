# Type on Specimen level

## openDS
Will be harmonised to `ods:type`
This is a new term that we will register in the openDS ontology.
This is the specimenType that we will use within DiSSCo.

## Mapping
At the moment this value needs to be explicitly set set as a default in the mapping file.
This does make the assumption that the type is the same for the full dataset.
We know this is an incorrect assumption and we are looking into getting the type from the provided data.
A user story for this has been made:
