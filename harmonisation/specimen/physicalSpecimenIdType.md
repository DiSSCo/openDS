# PhysicalSpecimenIdType

## openDS
Will be harmonised to `ods:physicalSpecimenIdType`
This is a new term that we will register in the openDS ontology.
It indicates the type of the physicalSpecimenId.
The current options are: 
- cetaf
- combined
However this might change in the future.

## Mapping
The physicalSpecimenIdType needs to be set in the default mapping.
It is not part of the data as it is difficult from the data to determine what the type of identifier is.
