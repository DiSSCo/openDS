## FDO Profile schemas

This folder contains a collection of FAIR Digital Object Profiles (FDO Profiles) specific to DiSSCo data model elements. 
Each folder represents a distinct profile for various digital objects like annotations, digital specimens, media objects, organisations. We also have profiles for DOI and Handle kernel, for mapping, machine annation service 
(mas), and digital object tomstone pages. These profiles are crucial for implementing FAIR principles and ensuring machine-actionability.


### Why separate FDO Profiles?

While some common metadata exists across profiles, distinct FDOs offer several advantages:

- Granularity: Tailored profiles cater to specific data object types, ensuring the most relevant metadata is captured.
- Extensibility: Profiles can be extended or inherit from others, promoting reusability and avoiding redundancy.
- Governance: Separate profiles facilitate the governance and maintenance of digital object types.
